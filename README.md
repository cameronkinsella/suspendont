## ⚠️ Deprecation Notice ⚠️

Due to Twitter's unsustainable API pricing change, Suspendon't is no longer functional.

## What is it?

Suspendon't tracks when someone you follow on Twitter has been suspended or has deleted their account. 
Your list of suspended and deleted users are updated automatically once every day, or when you press the manual refresh button.

There is a mobile and web version, but the mobile app is not available on the Apple Store or Google Play Store... yet!
